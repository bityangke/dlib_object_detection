# data file for loading information into dlib based object detector projects
# '#' are used for comments and will not be read in by the parser
# The file is organized in the following manner

#1 test data file: this is the file that contains the list of associated test data, text file format
# text file format: 0 -> grouped boxes (default), 1 -> open images bounding box format
