# data file for loading information into dlib based object detector projects
# '#' are used for comments and will not be read in by the parser
# The file is organized in the following manner

#1 test data file: this is the file that contains the list of associated test data, text file format
# text file format: 0 -> grouped boxes (default), 1 -> open images bounding box format
#D:/Projects/object_detection_data/dc/test/dc_test_full_input_v2.txt, 0

#2 network: this tells the code which trained network file to load

#3 version name: this is used as the prepend to all files, must end with "_"
